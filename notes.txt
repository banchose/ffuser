These setting caused problems

privacy.resistFingerprinting --> This puts time in UTC in Fastmail and potentially other web sites
security.cert_pinning.enforcement_level ---> set to 2, default 1.  Effects Zscaler and draw.io saving to Dropbox
security.mixed_content.block_active_content --> This breaks many sites when set to false

network.protocol-handler* --> I think this stopped me from saving to local on draw.io
